<h1>Brownie</h1>
</p>
A <b>brownie</b>, or simply a<b>brownie</b>, is a chocolate baked dessert bar. Brownies come in a variety of forms and may be either fudgy or cakey, depending on their density. Brownies often have a glossy "skin" on their upper crust and may include ingredients such as nuts, frosting, or chocolate chips. A variation containing brown sugar and vanilla rather than chocolate in the batter is called a blond brownie or blondie. The brownie was developed in the United States at the end of the 19th century and popularized in the country during the first half of the 20th century.

Brownies are typically eaten by hand or with utensils, and may be accompanied by a glass of milk, served warm with ice cream (à la mode), topped with whipped cream, or sprinkled with powdered sugar. In North America, they are common homemade treats and they are also popular in restaurants, ice cream parlors, and coffeehouses.[citation needed] The same popularity in cafes is seen in Sweden.[1]

In the Southern United States, brownies prepared from cake mix are a rare homemade dessert eaten on weekdays.[2]
